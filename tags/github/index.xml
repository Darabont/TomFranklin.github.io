      <description>Once you’ve written something, it’s time to go back to our buddy Terminal. There are some suggestions for pushing to GitHub using custom builds in RStudio here, but I found that this was more effort than it was worth (like I said, knowing the command line is a good thing) and anyway gave errors about permissions (I fully admit this may have been my own fault). The Hugo tutorial I linked to earlier suggests using a small bash script, but since it’s so small we can just as easily do it in Terminal.</description>
